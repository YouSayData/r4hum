# Recap Exercise I: Cleaning --------------------------------------------------

# 1. Read the file measurements.csv (https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/08/more-example-exams/measurements.csv)
# to create a tibble called measurements. 
# (The strings "rad", "sal", and "temp" in the quantity column stand for “radiation”, “salinity”, and “temperature” respectively.)
#
# 2. Create a tibble containing only rows where none of the values are NA and save in a tibble called cleaned.
#
# 3. Count the number of measurements of each type of quantity in cleaned. 
# Your result should have one row for each quantity "rad", "sal", and "temp".
# 
# 4. Display the minimum and maximum value of reading separately for each quantity in cleaned. Your result should have one row for each quantity "rad", "sal", and "temp".
#
# 5. Create a tibble in which all salinity ("sal") readings greater than 1 are divided by 100. 
# (This is needed because some people wrote percentages as numbers from 0.0 to 1.0, but others wrote them as 0.0 to 100.0.)
