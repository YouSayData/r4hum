# Introduction

## What is Geospatial Analysis?
- Analyzing data that has a spatial or geographical component.
- Examples:
  - Mapping weather stations.
  - Analyzing population density.
  - Visualizing coffee ratings by country.

## Key Concepts
- **Spatial Data**: Data linked to specific locations on Earth.
- **Coordinate Systems**: How spatial data is represented.
- **Projections**: Flattening the globe into a 2D map.

# Important Abbreviations (sf, st, crs)

## **What is `sf`?**
- **`sf`** stands for **Simple Features**.
- It's a standardized way to store and manipulate spatial data in R.
- Key features:
  - Encodes spatial objects like points, lines, polygons.
  - Stores attributes (non-spatial data) in a data frame.
  - Compatible with many R tools (e.g., `dplyr`, `ggplot2`).

## Structure of an `sf` object
1. **Geometry column**: Contains spatial information (e.g., coordinates).
2. **Attributes**: Data associated with the geometry (e.g., names, populations).

---

## **What is `st`?**
- **`st`** is a prefix for spatial functions in the `sf` package.
- Examples of commonly used `st` functions:
  - `st_read()`: Read spatial data from a file.
  - `st_write()`: Save spatial data to a file.
  - `st_transform()`: Change the coordinate reference system (CRS).
  - `st_crs()`: Query or set the CRS of spatial data.
  - `st_union()`: Combine multiple geometries into one.

---

## **What is CRS?**
- **CRS**: Coordinate Reference System.
- Defines how spatial data maps to Earth's surface.
- Two key components:
  1. **Datum**: Model of the Earth (e.g., WGS84).
  2. **Projection**: How the 3D Earth is flattened into 2D.

# Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

## Why is CRS Important?
- Ensures spatial data is aligned correctly.
- Enables accurate distance, area, and location calculations.
- Helps to overlay datasets with different projections.

## Common CRSs
- **EPSG:4326 (WGS84)**:
  - Latitude/Longitude.
  - Default for many datasets.
- **EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator)**:
  - Used in web maps (e.g., Google Maps).
- **Custom Projections**:
  - E.g., Mollweide, Robinson for specific visualization purposes.

# Projections

## What are Projections?
- A way to transform the spherical Earth into a flat 2D map.
- All projections introduce some distortions:
  - **Area** (size of land masses).
  - **Shape** (angles, distances).
  - **Distance** (accuracy of measurements).

---

## Types of Projections
1. **Equal-Area Projections**:
   - Preserves area but distorts shape.
   - Example: Mollweide projection.
   
2. **Conformal Projections**:
   - Preserves angles and shapes locally but distorts area.
   - Example: Mercator projection.

3. **Compromise Projections**:
   - Balances distortions in area, shape, and distance.
   - Example: Robinson projection.
